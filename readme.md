# A site about birch trees

## Background:
The idea behind this project was to get a better understanding of HTML, CSS and various other features taught by Code Insitute. 
Due to the last couple of months hardship I have had to finish this project in a day.


## UX and design choices:
When choosing this design it was meant to be simple, and responsive. 
In other words, it was developed around bootstrap. 


## User Stories:
1. "I want to know about birch trees."
2. "Where can I know more about birch trees?"
3. "I want to find a dirty joke about birch trees."
	
### The Wireframe:
I drew one picture of each page, then built it.

Page | Link to image of wireframe
------------ | -------------
index.html | [index](https://github.com/isitaslinky/Interactivefrontend/blob/master/images/homepage.jpg)
moreinfo.html | [moreinfo](https://github.com/isitaslinky/Interactivefrontend/blob/master/images/moreinfo.jpg)
gallery.html | [gallery](https://github.com/isitaslinky/Interactivefrontend/blob/master/images/gallery.jpg)

## Features:
1. Landing page
	- 4 cards describing basic things about birch trees.
	- 4 images related to the topics mentioned.

2. More info
	- A short background about why I chose birch trees.
	- A list of the most interesting facts about birch trees I could find.
    - A single dirty joke about birch trees.

3. Gallery
	- 9 photos of birch trees, royalty free.

4. Day/Night mode
    - Javascript function that checks for toggling of night mode. 

## Existing Features:
1. Navbar
	- Came with bootstrap, easy and intuitive navigation.
2. Overall grid-system was used from bootstrap, no need to mess with spacing etc.  
3. Javascript programming language


## Technologies used to create this website:
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) - Building the basic structure of the website, the very core of the site.
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) - Styling the website in conjunction with Bootstrap.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Assisted in creating the grid system of the website, the table and the submission element.
- [Google](https://google.com) - To research, troubleshoot and investigate bugs with the website. 
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - Glanced at other peoples problems and how they solved their issues.
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Using a client sided text editor for creating the readme and certain code snippets.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Used for deplying, updating, sharing and maintaining the website.
- [GitPod IDE](https://gitpod.io/) - Could not have developed the website without Gitpod. 
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - Tested various situations by emulating the devices needed to make compatibility. 
- [Apple iPhone 7](https://www.apple.com/) - Tested the mobile website for bugs. 
- [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/software-download/windows10) - The OS responsible for running each tool. 
- [Code Institute Training and Study Materials](https://courses.codeinstitute.net/) - Learning by doing and doing while learning.
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - Toggling day/night mode.


## Testing:
1. Tested using various mobile emulators on my Windows Machine.
2. Tested on mobile to ensure the links, layout and scaling works as intended.
3. Tested using responsive design in the browser on most used breakpoints. 
4. Had friends and family test the website on their devices and received design feedback.
6. Ran a [CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).
    - Result: Pass
7. Ran a [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
    - Results:
    - index = pass
    - moreinfo = pass
    - gallery = pass
6. Ran an online [responsiveness tester](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#).
    - Result: yes(is it perfect, no.)

## What I would like to work on in the future:
- Locally stored day/night mode for the site to remember across pages. 
- Faster image loading times, I suspect the problem with the loading is that the images are too large.
- Add a footer with social information.


## Bugs and their resolution:
1. 	Bootstrap initial spacing and padding caused problems when scaling responsively.
2.  Day/night mode caused lots of problems, mainly not targeting elements properly.
3.  Had a div inside the label, the HTML validator did not like that. Troubleshooted and fixed [stackoverflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4461942/html-tags-inside-label).
4.  Various other bugs I forgot to write down before making changes. 

## Deployment:
Ensured all tools were installed, this includes:
1. Using the GitPod IDE plugin for Chrome.
2. Installed Notepad++ to keep a local copy.
3. Ensured Chrome was up to date, latest version installed. Version 87.0.4280.66 (Official Build) (64-bit)
4. Accessed the Code Institude project template.
5. Uploaded commits whenever I needed to take a break longer than 15 minutes.
6. Hosting the website on GitHub Pages.


## Credits:
Content Ive used from my search history, and not in any particular order, and I probably missed some links.
Honestly, I am so far behind with my study because of work that I dont fully understand why the toggler works, but I am relieved that it does.
Thank you youtube and google.
