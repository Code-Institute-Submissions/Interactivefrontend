# A site about birch trees

## Background:
The idea behind this project was to get a better understanding of HTML, CSS and various other features taught by Code Insitute. 
Due to the last couple of months hardship I have had to finish this project in a day.


## UX and design choices:
When choosing this design it was meant to be simple, and responsive. 
In other words, it was developed around bootstrap. 


## User Stories:
1. "I want to know about birch trees."
2. "Where can I know more about birch trees?"
3. "I want to find a dirty joke about birch trees."
	
### The Wireframe:
I drew one picture of each page, then built it.

## What I would like to work on in the future:
- Locally stored day/night mode for the site to remember across pages. 
- Faster image loading times, I suspect the problem with the loading is that the images are too large.
- Add a footer with social information.


## Bugs and their resolution:
1. 	bootstrap spacing and padding caused problems when scaling responsively.
2.  Day/night mode caused lots of problems, mainly not targeting elements properly.


## Deployment:
Ensured all tools were installed, this includes:
1. Using the GitPod IDE plugin for Chrome.
2. Installed Notepad++ to keep a local copy.
3. Ensured Chrome was up to date, latest version installed. Version 87.0.4280.66 (Official Build) (64-bit)
4. Accessed the Code Institude project template.
5. Uploaded commits whenever I needed to take a break longer than 15 minutes.
6. Hosting the website on GitHub Pages.
