            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 28, 2020 by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/isitaslinky">Casper</a></p>

            <p>I wanted to share some knowledge about Birch trees, so I made this website.</p>
        <hr>
            
            <h2>Why Birches?</h2>
            <p>I've always been interested in being outside as a child, one of the most common trees around my hometown consisted of Birches.
            You really cannot go wrong with Birches, they are resillient trees which eventually grow their way into your heart.</p>
        <br>
            <h3>Interesting Facts about Birches</h3>
            <p>Most of these can be discovered online with ease, but I selected the most interesting ones to share with you.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Birch oil is used in the manufacture of Russia leather, a water-resistant leather.</li>
              <li>Birch seeds are used as leaf litter in miniature terrain models.</li>
              <li>The Hughes H-4 Hercules was made mostly of birch wood, despite its better-known moniker, "The Spruce Goose".</li>
              <li>Birch twigs bound in a bundle, also called birch, were used for birching, a form of corporal punishment.</li>

            </ul>
        <br>
            <h3>A short joke before we move along:</h3>
            <p><i>Two tall trees, a birch and a beech, are growing in the woods.</i>
            A small tree begins to grow between them, and the beech says to the birch, "Is that a son of a beech or a son of a birch?" birch says he cannot tell.
            <i>Just then a woodpecker lands on the sapling..</i> 
            The birch says, "Woodpecker, you are a tree expert. Can you tell if that is a son of a beech or a son of a birch?"
            <i>The woodpecker takes a taste of the small tree..</i> He replies, "It is neither a son of a beech nor a son of a birch. It is, however, the best piece of ash I have ever put my pecker in."</p>
